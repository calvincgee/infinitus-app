# Infinitus Project

Here is my solution to the Infinitus take-home project.

## Testing Instructions

1. Open up the link found [here](https://calvincgee.github.io/infinitus-app/).
2. Categories should be listed horizontally across the screen.
3. Click the yellow buttons to expand the categories and explore the capabilities.
4. Enabled capabilites have a green background as labelled.
5. The page calls the API endpoint every time the page loads. To test this you can change the data at the specified endpoint and refresh the page.
